-Turn Super Sonic requires 2,4,5,6 in the Level Select Sound Test and pressing B+A or C+A at roughly the same time from the ground. 

-Sonic and Tails both have no roll-lock.

-Sonic's Y-velocity cap when rolling is removed, potentially making him go higher than before

-The title screen now lasts a more appropriate length.

-Act Clear jingle is there at the end of the act. (The implementation of this change did break zones from Mushroom Valley to Doomsday however)

-Sega Screen palette has been fixed.

-Debug is turned off by default except for the pause function, The Sonic 2 options let you select character as well as listen to the sound test.

-Knuckles is "playable", although he's mostly just Sonic. A palette change is made, but it doesn't always work. (The 3rd shade of blue isn't touched, as well as underwater and super palettes. Doing these actions will change the color back)

-UP UP, DOWN DOWN, UP UP for Level select and Debug Mode.

-When Level Select is enabled, A+Start for Sonic&Tails, B for Sonic Alone, C for Tails Alone, and sound test code 1,3,5,7 for Knuckles.

-Proper explosion sound.

-Robotnik in LBZ2 takes 8 hits instead of 1.
